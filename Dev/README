Additional Features: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added support for using pipes "|". Tested by using grep. The way it was 
implemented was by redirecting the output of the command before "|" to 
an intermediate file and then let the command after "|" use it as stdin. 
Implemented a small method by which we can add n number of "|". Again 
tested using grep. 

Pressing Ctrl+C doesn't exit the shell. Instead it interrups the process
which is running in the foreground and if no process is running in foreground
then it does nothing. Shell can be exit only by typing "exit"
