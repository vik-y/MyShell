Requirements Completed:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
All requirements mentioned in the pdf are met.

How jobs were implemented? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Made a structure job. Made an array of it and allocated it as a shared 
memory so that all processes could see it. Whenever background job 
was requested, a new fork was made which added to the new job to 
jobs array and did execvp to run the job and waited till it completed. 
The same jobs array was used to show background jobs and remaining 
processes..

How history was implemented?
A history array was made. This was not shared. In the main thread every
command typed got copied to this array.  

The way in which code works is very clearly mentioned in the code. 

I added two new files: jobs.h and jobs.c to make handling of jobs easier. 



Incomplete Requirements: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
None. All done


Additional Features: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Added support for using pipes "|". Tested by using grep. The way it was 
implemented was by redirecting the output of the command before "|" to 
an intermediate file and then let the command after "|" use it as stdin. 
Implemented a small method by which we can add n number of "|". Again 
tested using grep. 

Pressing Ctrl+C doesn't exit the shell. Instead it interrups the process
which is running in the foreground and if no process is running in foreground
then it does nothing. Shell can be exit only by typing "exit"

Modified makefile to remove the restrictions imposed by ansi standard

A well documented code.
